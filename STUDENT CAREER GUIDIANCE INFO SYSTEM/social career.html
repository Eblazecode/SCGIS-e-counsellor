<div align="center" style="background-color: steelblue; margin:4%;padding:5%;color: #ffffff;">
    <p>social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships <br>
    among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered <br>
    a "social science". The social sciences include, but are not limited to, economics, political <br>
    science, human geography, demography, management, psychology, sociology, anthropology, archaeology<br>
    jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes<br>
    used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society',<br>
    established in the 19th century.<br>
    The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college<br>
    or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic <br>
    journals in which research is published, and the learned social science societies <br>
    and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. <br>
