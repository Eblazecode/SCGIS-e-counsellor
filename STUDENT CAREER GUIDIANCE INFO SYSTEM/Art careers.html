<div style="background-color: dodgerblue;padding: 10%;color: #ffffff;">
    <p>Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts<br>
        (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated<br>
        for their beauty or emotional power.</p>
        In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism<br>
        of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.<br>
<p>
        The oldest documented forms of art are visual arts, which include creation of <br>
        images or objects in fields including today painting, sculpture, printmaking,<br>
        photography, and other visual media.
</p>
       <p> Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, <br>
        or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of <br>
        use are essentialâ€”in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.<br>
</p>
    <p>    Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media<br>
        such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the arts.Until the 17th <br>
        century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences.</p>
